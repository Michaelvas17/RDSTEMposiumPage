#The River Dell High School STEMposium Website Development Respository (phew... long title, I know)

It's live!
You can view the site live at this link [here](https://riverdell.org/stemposium)

A development version is still available [here](https://rdhs-stemposium.github.io/site)

### About
This is the repo for the development of the STEMposium site.

This repo serves only for the development of the site, and the site will be hosted on the riverdell.org domain eventually.

All source files will remain here, of course.
