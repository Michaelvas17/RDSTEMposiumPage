# River Dell HS STEMposium Page
This is the repo for the development of the STEMposium site.

This repo serves only for the development of the site, and the site will be hosted on the riverdell.org domain eventually.

All source files will remain here, of course. (i.e. CSS, JS, Python, and a copy of the page)
